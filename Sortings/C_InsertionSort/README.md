# Insertion Sort


In this itterate through the collection forward. 
Run a pointer in backward direction till we encounter any element smaller than given element.
Remove the element from current index and place it after the backward pointer position.

* If list is nearly sorted it will only take itteration = number of elements.

* It is good for LinkedList, in case of array all the elements must be shifted from the place where given element is to be inserted.

Time complecity : (Best = 0(n)) (Average = 0(n2)) (Worst = 0(n2))
